1. Generating Initial Hypotheses

Start on the "Generator" Page: Navigate to the main page. You will see a primary input field for your research question.
Enter Your Question: In the text area, type a clear and concise research question you wish to explore. Example: "How can quantum entanglement explain consciousness?"
Generate: Click the "Generate Hypotheses" button. The AI will analyze your question, discover connections across different domains, and formulate a set of innovative hypotheses.
Review the Results: The generated hypotheses will be displayed, ranked by a confidence score. Each hypothesis includes:
Textual Proof: A step-by-step reasoning chain that logically supports the conclusion.
Newly Discovered Knowledge Units: Novel concepts or variables created by the AI to support its reasoning.

2. Deepening a Hypothesis

Explore Further: If a specific hypothesis interests you, you can delve deeper into it.
Click "Deepen": Locate the "Deepen" button beneath the hypothesis you want to explore.
Ask a Follow-up Question: A dialog box will appear. Here, you can ask a specific question to guide the AI's next step. Example: "How does this concept apply to black holes?"
View Deepened Results: The AI will generate a new, more detailed hypothesis based on your inquiry. This new result will appear nested directly below the original one, creating a clear "thread" of your exploration.

3. Reviewing Your History

Access the "History" Page: Click on the "History" tab in the main navigation bar.
Browse Past Results: This page contains a complete log of all hypotheses you have ever generated, including both initial and deepened results, sorted by date.
Continue Exploration: Every entry in your history has the same functionality as on the main page. You can click "Deepen" on any past hypothesis to pick up an old train of thought and continue exploring it at any time.
Clear History: If you wish to start fresh, you can use the "Clear History" button to permanently delete all saved entries. You will be asked to confirm this action.
